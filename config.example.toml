# Day/Night Switcher Configuration

# Time configuration (required)
day_begin = "06:00:00"
night_begin = "18:00:00"

# Actions to run when switching to day mode
day_action = [
    "/bin/echo", "Good morning, switching to light theme!"
]

# Actions to run when switching to night mode
night_action = [
    "/bin/echo", "Good evening, switching to dark theme!"
]

# Wallpaper action (cron expression, optional)
wallpaper_cron = "0 9 * * *"
wallpaper_action = ["/path/to/wallpaper-switch.sh"]

# Sleep monitor configuration (optional, default: "polling")
# Options:
#   - "polling": Uses sysctl to poll sleep/wake status (default, works everywhere)
#   - "native": Uses macOS IOKit for real-time notifications (requires special build)
#
# Note: "native" requires building with CGo:
#   CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags iokit -o day-night-switcher
#
# For normal usage, "polling" is recommended as it's simpler and more reliable
sleep_monitor = "polling"
